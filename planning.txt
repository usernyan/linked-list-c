The goal of this project is to create a generic and small linked list library in c.

The struct for nodes of the list will be:
- a pointer to the next node
- a void pointer to the data

The functions that operate on the linked list will be passed function pointers to call with the data pointer as an argument.
For example, for a linked list that holds ints, the delete function will take the index of the node to delete and also a function that simply free()'s the data pointer.
The user of the library can implement more complex behavior in said function(s) if it's needed.
